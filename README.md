# Janggi

Jangi is a traditional Korean chess-like game where two players move a piece turn-by-turn and defeat the opponent by killing the King at the end. The project's aim is to write a Python program where two players can play, and implement machine learning algorithms to play the game for the sake of learning.

I started this project a while ago, but have only begun writing code recently. I have decided to move on from this project because I have other ideas. Feel free to do whatever you want with the code here. I will return to this project to finish it once I am done with others.

## Tasks

1. Create a Janggi game using pygame package, where two players can play against each other.
2. Write AI program which will play and improve after each iterations.
3. Have fun!
