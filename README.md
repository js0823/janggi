# Jangi

Jangi is a traditional Asian chess-like game where two players move a piece turn-by-turn and defeat the opponent by killing the King at the end. In this project, the aim is to write a Python program where either two players can play.

## Tasks

1. Write a code to generate Jangi board with pieces.
2. Apply Jangi rules.
3. Be able to show where the piece can move to when a piece is selected.
4. Add a simple AI for testing.
5. Add feature to play the game.
6. Add screen to choose number of players.
7. Improve AI by using machine learning to learn to play the game.
